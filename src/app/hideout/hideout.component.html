    <p class="center">In the hideout, players can invest in and build different stations within it, such as a shooting range for skill improvement, a medstation for healing and recovery,
      a laboratory for crafting and upgrading items, and more. Upgrading these stations requires resources that players can find in raids or trade for,
      and as players invest in their hideout, they unlock new benefits and abilities. Here is a list of all the stations in the hideout!
